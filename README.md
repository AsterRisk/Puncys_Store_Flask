# Puncys_Store_Flask

Run Order:
  Start your MySQL service and create a database called puncys_store_1. You could use a different name, but that will require editing the engine creation on line 5 of application/setup.py 
  Run setup.py
  set FLASK_APP=<path to application/router.py>
  flask run
  --Should be fine from here--
